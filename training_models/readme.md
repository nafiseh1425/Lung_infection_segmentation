“Models.py” is the actual code of attention residual UNet model, we used it as is.  

For the infection Segmentation we had combined 5 “Attention residual UNet” models as follows:  

Model 1:

 Note:

 NOTE:  The above models are the results of changes in "Infection-Augmented.ipynb"


 The FPN model is from the library of "segmentation model" for the Severity Segmentation.
