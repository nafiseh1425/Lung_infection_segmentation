# Lung_infection_segmentation
To assist clinicians in overcoming the challenge of manual infection segmentation, we developed a new method to automatically segment and quantify the percentage of the infected lung volume.
For the infection segmentation, we have used an ensemble technique and combined five Attention residual UNet models.
