# Lung_infection_segmentation
To assist clinicians in overcoming the challenge of manual infection segmentation, we developed a new method to automatically segment and quantify the percentage of the infected lung volume.
We used an ensemble technique for the infection segmentation and combined five Attention residual UNet models.
